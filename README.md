## Installation of release and development versions

MultiAssayExperiment is under active development, and we highly recommend
installing a current development version rather than the release Bioconductor
version. This can be done by installing the
[development version of Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/useDevel/):

```
library(BiocInstaller)
useDevel()
biocLite("MultiAssayExperiment")
```

## Ready-to-use `MultiAssayExperiment` objects

See the newly released `curatedTCGAData` `ExperimentHub` package for
ready-packaged MultiAssayExperiment TCGA objects.

```
biocLite("curatedTCGAData")
```

## Documentation

The `MultiAssayExperiment` API is available by browsing to the
[API wiki](https://github.com/waldronlab/MultiAssayExperiment/wiki/MultiAssayExperiment-API).

## The `MultiAssayExperiment` Bioconductor Special Interest Group

This group meets remotely to discuss this project approximately every 3 weeks.
If you are interested, please join the
[MultiAssayExperiment Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biocmultiassay)
and see the
[calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=9ar0qc8mpkv6b9intgmdcdf0ss%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York)
of upcoming meetings.
