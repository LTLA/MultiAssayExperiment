# Installation of release and development versions

MultiAssayExperiment is under active development, and we highly recommend installing a current development version rather than the release Bioconductor version. This can be done either by installing the [development version of Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/useDevel/), or by installing from Github:

`BiocInstaller::biocLite("waldronlab/MultiAssayExperiment")`

# Ready-to-use MultiAssayExperiment objects

See http://tinyurl.com/MAEOurls for ready-packaged MultiAssayExperiment TCGA and CCLE objects  to try out.

# Documentation

See the 

A definition of the API is available by typing `API()` after loading the MultiAssayExperiment library, which opens the [API wiki](https://github.com/waldronlab/MultiAssayExperiment/wiki/MultiAssayExperiment-API).


# The MultiAssayExperiment Bioconductor special interest group

This group meets remotely to discuss this project approximately every 3 weeks. If you are interested, please join the [MultiAssayExperiment Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biocmultiassay) and see the [calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=9ar0qc8mpkv6b9intgmdcdf0ss%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York) of upcoming meetings.
